This dataset is a result of a [Axios and Harris Poll](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/2022-axios-harris-poll-100-rankings) to gauage the reputation of the most visible brands in America. See [Harris Poll overview](https://theharrispoll.com/partners/media/axios-harrispoll-100/) for details on methodology. The dataset contains a reputation quality score and rank for the Top 100 firms for year 2022. It also contains the rank and reputation quality score for these firms for the five prior years.

The dataset was previously shared on [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-05-31).
